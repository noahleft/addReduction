# addReduction
This is a simple project to demo how to use openCL in a simple task: "adding many numbers".

To solve the problem, we use C++ with OpenCL and Pthread.

To use the code in mac, you should create a new empty project and add files (*.cc and *.hh) into projects.
The Xcode will maintain the rest.
